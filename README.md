# Weight Plate

This project utilizes the tools required to develop an E-Commerce Website, but was used to bring an idea of mine into life. 
A restaurant geared towards those on a fitness journey is what this "restaurant" is all about. "Weight Plate has the weight for your plate".
I utilized these E-Commerce essentials in order to simulate a real restaurant chain's website from Google Maps' API to display the locations of the restaurant chain to a cart that can be easily updated to the user's desires. 

_Technologies Used: Shopify, GraphQL, React, Tailwind, NextJS_

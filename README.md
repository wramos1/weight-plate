This project utilizes the tools required to develop an E-Commerce Website, and brings a much needed restaurant into life;
a restaurant geared towards those on a fitness journey. 

### "Weight Plate has the weight for your plate".

I utilized these E-Commerce essentials in order to simulate a real restaurant chain's website from using the Google Maps' API to display the locations to a cart that can be easily updated to the user's desires. 

> All pages excluding the Order, Menu, and Cart pages are mock pages to align with a business oriented application.

## Order

  - The order page is simply to simulate a restaurant chain's website which makes the user select the location of the restaurant they wish to order from.
  - This enables restaurant's to send the order from the website to the specified location.
  - A user can only start ordering their food once a location has been selected.
    - In order to keep this application easy to navigate, I excluded that feature.

## Menu

  - Navigate to the menu page to begin adding items to your cart.

  - Select an item you wish to view, update the quantity or type if you desire, and press purchase to add to cart.
  - You will be able to see the change to the price as you add or remove from the quantity.

## Cart

  - The cart icon will take you to your cart where you could view your order's total.
  - Here, you will be able to remove an item and update the quantity of an item that is already in your cart.
  - The checkout button will take you to Shopify's own templated check out page.
